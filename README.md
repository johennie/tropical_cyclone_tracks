# tropical_cyclone_tracks
The Tropical Cyclone Tracks dataset from Kaggle tracks tropical cyclones through the years; it uses the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale to classify storms into different categories. 
Methodology: At first, I sorted the dataset by category, grouped it by year and plotted the data using the seaborn library for a histogram and the plotly.express library for a pairplot

Results: both the scatter plot and the histogram showed that as the years progressed the number of Tropical Cyclones has increased and their severity has worsened (presenting more severe and damaging categories).
To verify that, I looked at scatter and line plots by category. Here is H4 as an example:

They show the number of storms and their severity increased on more recent years.
